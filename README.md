We will be covering the basics and array creation, indexing and slicing, basic operations, universal functions.
A Python list is a container that allows you to store and access data.
Each element is associated with an index. We can access each element using a square bracket.
A numpy array or ND array is similar to a list.
It's usually fixed in size and each element is of the same type, in this case integers. 
We can cast a list to a numpy array by first importing numpy. 
We then cast the list as follows; we can access the data via an index.
As with the list, we can access each element with an integer and a square bracket.
As numpy arrays contain data of the same type, we can use the attribute dtype to obtain the data type of the array's elements.
